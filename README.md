# MiCard App Challenge

Hey folks! This app is the continuation of the layout_challenge_app. I coded this app from scratch because unfortunate things happened to the other app.
So we can actually call it version 2.1 of the challenge. 

I learned to use the [Card class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Card-class.html) while making this application.
I also used the [Padding class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Padding-class.html) to add padding. This is something I just learned. Well done to me.
And finally, I used the [ListTile class](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ListTile-class.html). This is also something new for me. 


I will continue to learn. Good luck to me.
